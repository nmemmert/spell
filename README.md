## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development

docker-compose up --build

# Or run in background (recommended for production)
docker-compose up -d --build

# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the application
docker-compose down
```

### Manual Docker Build
```bash
# Build the production image
docker build -t spelling-hub:beta .

# Run the container with volume mount
docker run -d \
  --name spelling-hub \
  -p 3000:3000 \

  spelling-hub:beta
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Docker Configuration
- **Single Stage Build**: Node.js application with Express server and SQLite database
- **SQLite Database**: File-based database with volume persistence (`./data:/app/data`)
- **Volume Mount**: Database persists across container restarts and deployments
- **Port 3000**: Application runs on port 3000 with both API and static file serving
- **Cross-Device Persistence**: Any device accessing the container shares the same data

## AWANA T&T Bible Typing

This application includes a comprehensive Bible typing practice feature specifically designed for AWANA's Truth & Training (T&T) program. Students can practice typing all 35 official T&T verses to improve both typing skills and Scripture memorization.

### Features:

- **Two Practice Modes**:
  - Full Verse: Type the entire verse from memory
  - Progressive Reveal: Text appears word-by-word as you type correctly
- **Real-time Feedback**: Character-by-character accuracy highlighting
- **Performance Tracking**: Accuracy percentage and words-per-minute
- **Gamification**: Earn points and badges for perfect typing
- **Scripture Master Badge**: Awarded for 100% accuracy on any verse

## Wordlist Management

The spelling game uses wordlists that teachers create and assign to students:

### For Teachers:
- Create custom wordlists with any vocabulary
- Assign wordlists to specific students
- Organize by weeks, themes, or difficulty levels
- Track student progress on assigned words

### For Students:
- Practice words from assigned wordlists
- Use spaced repetition for optimal learning
- Get detailed results showing correct/incorrect answers
- Earn points and badges for progress

### Default Behavior:
- Students see words from all their assigned wordlists
- If no wordlists are assigned, default practice words are provided
- Teachers can access the Wordlists page to manage assignments

## Data Persistence

The application uses a SQLite database with volume mounting for **cross-device persistent storage**:

### Architecture
- **Backend API**: Express.js server with RESTful API endpoints
- **Database**: SQLite with file-based storage in container volume
- **Volume Mounting**: Database persists across container restarts and deployments
- **Cross-Device Access**: Any device accessing the container shares the same data

### What Gets Saved:
- **User Accounts**: All registered users with their roles and information
- **Wordlists**: Custom wordlists created by teachers, including student assignments
- **Data Persistence**: Survives container restarts, updates, and server reboots

### Volume Configuration:
- **Mount Point**: `./data:/app/data` (host directory to container)
- **Database Path**: `/app/data/app.db` inside container
- **Backup**: Copy `./data/app.db` to backup the entire database

### API Endpoints:
- `GET /api/users` - Get all users
- `POST /api/users` - Create new user
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user
- `GET /api/wordlists` - Get all wordlists
- `POST /api/wordlists` - Create new wordlist
- `PUT /api/wordlists/:id` - Update wordlist
- `DELETE /api/wordlists/:id` - Delete wordlist
